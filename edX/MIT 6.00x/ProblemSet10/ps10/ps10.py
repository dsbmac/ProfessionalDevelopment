def load_map(mapFilename):

    Parses the map file and constructs a directed graph

    Parameters: 
        mapFilename : name of the map file

    Assumes:
        Each entry in the map file consists of the following four positive 
        integers, separated by a blank space:
            From To TotalDistance DistanceOutdoors
        e.g.
            32 76 54 23
